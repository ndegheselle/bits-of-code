Socket communication to send messages between two instances of the applications.

## Feed back

Based on WebKit < 13.1 so not compatible with some modern javascript.
Less practical, not obviously more performant than some other solutions (tauri for exemple)
    - Interop is not practical
    - Debugging HTML/Javascript is possible but hard to setup
